importing and exporting js code 

    Import external js code/file to another js code 

    import 

1. any js code, which is using import keyworkd has to be loaded as a module not as type jscode .

    2. "export" is the predefined keyword using which any js resource (varaible, obj, func etc) can be exported which can be imported in other js File

            export var a = 90;
            export class ABC {

            }
            export sample = () => {
                
            }
    3. export default can only be used once within the module,
